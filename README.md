# DerivativesPricing with Cpp
## 0. Introduction
This documentation is for derivatives pricing with C++. There are several main methods used in computational finance: Exact Solution, Monte Carlo Method and Finite Difference Method. The fundamental derivatives pricing theories were clearly discussed in ACTSC_446, which is an undergraduate course focused on derivative pricing at the University of Waterloo. Another course, CS_335, implemented thoes theories with Python. In this project, with using OOP and GP techniques, I would build a framework and implement those methods to price European equity options and perpetual American Options. More exotic options could be added as derived objects, and priced by Monte Carlo method in this porject.
