# DerivativesPricing with Cpp
## 0. Introduction
This documentation is for derivatives pricing with C++. There are several main methods used in computational finance: Exact Solution, Monte Carlo Method and Finite Difference Method. The fundamental derivatives pricing theories was clearly discussed in ACTSC_446, which is an undergraduate course focused on derivative pricing at the University of Waterloo. Another course, CS_335, implemented thoes theories with Python.
